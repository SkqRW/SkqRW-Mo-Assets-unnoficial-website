A repository for as many Rain World Modding things as possible!
Basic questions I can already see being asked answered below.

Q: What is the point of this repository?
A: The point of this repository is to give people access to as many Rain World modding assets as possible! The plans are to include Tiles, Effects, Props, Documentation on making the former 3 listed items, Project files of regions, arenas, and even gallery posts if possible!

Q: Hasn't this already been done?
A: Not all of it! And a little competition isn't a bad thing. :)

Q: If my assets are included will I be credited?
A: Yes! I will make sure to credit every addition properly.

Q: How can I help?
A: You can help by joining the Discord and providing insight and/or any assets you'd be willing to! Linked on the github here :)
